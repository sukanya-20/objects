            <dd>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment.</dd>
            <dt><b>MACHINE LEARNING</b></dt>
            <dd>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. IBM has a rich history with machine learning</dd>
            <dt><b>DATA SCIENCE</b></dt>
            <dd>Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions</dd>
            <dt><b>Computer vision</b></dt>
            <dd>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.</dd>
            <dt><b>cloud Computing</b></dt>
            <dd>cloud computing is an abstraction of compute, storage, and network infrastructure assembled as a platform on which applications </dd>
